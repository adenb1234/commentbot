Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,She is one of the greatest athletes ever. And she is even a better person.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Indeed. The number of trolls who carped about how she ""let down our country"" was truly appalling. Let THEM flip around in the air and try to figure out which way is up. And do you believe for a minute the vitriol would have been like this for a White gymnast?"
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"It is an amazing comeback. I suspect that almost no one else could have come back from that mental health crisis like she has. Whether or not she wins in Paris, she has showed amazing strength, integrity, and compassion for others. And she is already a winner in my book."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"""Kerri Strug‚Äôs infamous vault on an injured ankle at the 1996 Atlanta Games, as Bela Karolyi yelled 'You can do it!' from the sidelines looks alarming to the world today."" Actually, I was appalled by it at the time: I felt he was pushing her into a situation where she could end up permanently crippled. As for Simone, love her, love her, love her, but I did not even know that she is the reason they stopped with the stupid pink leotards and returned to wearing U.S.A. colors! [And I love pink, but not when you're competing for your country!]"
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,She is amazing and awe-inspiring and not just because of her gymnastics. I love it when couch potatoes trash talk elite athletes. They have no idea what that pressure is like. And shame on trash talkers who bash athletes from our own country who are giving it their all and trying their best! Go Simone! Go TEAM USA!üíô‚ô•Ô∏èüíô
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,Biles is an incredibly talented athlete that personifies personal strength and character.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,She is such a remarkable woman; I wish nothing but the best for Simone Biles. üá∫üá∏üëçüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüíö
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Great article, recognizing the important changes Simone has brought to the gymnastics ‚Äúindustry‚Äù and that it has not compromised, but actually enhanced, performance. Not to mention nurturing the happiness and well-being of the practitioners. Now if that sensibility could just be reflected in other sports - and other occupations for that matter. Looking forward to watching Simone and all the competitors for the sheer grit and discipline to even get to the Olympics, not to mention their beauty and grace"
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Team leotards with higher necklines and a more mature style is good. Even better would be if those leotards had bottoms that fully covered the wearers' bottoms, the way women's ballet leotards do. You rarely see ballerinas constantly fishing their leotards out of their rear ends, and their leotard style gives them a much nicer line than gymnasts' leotards do."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,Biles changed the world. Now the rest of us need to change ourselves- by internalizing the message that everything she is being praised for is normal. It's the world that she refused to accept that was broken. Except for her gymnastics itself. That's way beyond normal.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Gymnastics is an inherently dangerous sport. It's unconscionable that a coach would pressure any gymnast into performing if they don't feel ready to compete for any reason, physical or mental. Simone Biles was smart to bow out when she felt she wasn't up to it. Instead of making a great comeback now, she could have suffered permanent injuries or worse if she had decided to power through a competition she didn't feel up to."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,Go Simone Biles!!! She is a hugely inspiring human being!
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Absolutely. One might say heroic. But, whatever happens, she's earned the right to simply take as much joy as possible away from the competition, regardless the results. Social media be damned."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"I was seriously shocked when she dropped out. I was even more shocked and angered by the backlash of people who couldn't do a pushup to save their lives. The mewling about destroying the team? Hah. Flip it around. How do you think the team felt when they got trashed for not all being Simone? Essentially the trolls were saying that the rest of them were losers without her. Bull! Every event had an American on the podium. Suni took the all around. The team without Simone took silver. Simone came back and took bronze in beam. Jade won the floor. Suni won bronze on the unevens. Mykayla took silver in vault. No, it wasn't the Simone Biles gold rush show, but it was much more exciting and suspenseful for this viewer. And it pleased me that athletes who were not from the US got some rightful attention. A guy who knew a lot about winning often said, ""Enough with the stats and the predictions. You have to get out there and play the game. That's the only thing."" I miss John Madden, even though I don't like football."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,Those FBI clowns who wouldn‚Äôt even open an investigation. I hope their names become well known to the public and they receive all manner of bad karma that the universe can dump on them.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,Yes. They are women and they should not be subjected to wearing those costumes that don't cover their derrieres.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,She is amazing.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"She really is incredible. I'm rooting for her to win it all as well, but even if she doesn't, she's one of the most incredible athletes and leaders of all time. Thanks for this article. I wish her the best in all that she does and am grateful that she's inspiring the next generation (and some of us older generations)."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Cue the idiots who complain about her struggles in the previous Olympics. You know the ones who have accomplished so much less than Biles but like to spout off. She is the greatest gymnast of all time based on any standard set. Olympics, world championships or really anything. Let's hope she performs up to her abilities and is safe from injury."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,Great article!
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,Ms. Biles is an extraordinary human being in many ways. It‚Äôs a privilege to watch her work.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,She is such a marvel and joy to watch!
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,Biles is the greatest of all time in gymnastics. Her ability to stay at the top so long when so many succumb to injury and time is outstanding. I hope she and all the Olympians in all sports perform up to their own personal standards. I am not as much of a gymnastics fan but can appreciate her incredible achievements.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,Thank you for this opinion. It allows me to appreciate her even more. I don‚Äôt remember if she ever carried the US flag for opening ceremonies but I can‚Äôt think of a more appropriate person. Her accomplishments and resilience are second to none.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,She‚Äôs a great role model!
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,Bela Karolyi is a disgraceful human. I didn‚Äôt bother to Google him but I sincerely hope he has met an untimely demise with malice.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"I agree with this and all the other, many, articles lauding Simone Bile's incredible strength etc. I am a long-time gymnastics follower and a huge fan of hers. But I hope she's tuning out all this media attention, and I kind of wish everyone would just let her alone, let her do her work. Hopefully she's gotten better at ignoring the pressure, but I still wish it wasn't so intensely focused on her."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Not only a strong woman, but a woman who knows herself."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Gymnasts describe the twisties as losing the ability to feel where your body is in the air, literally not sensing which way is up when you are twisting and flipping that fast. The cure is to go back to a gym with a big ball pit to ensure soft landings and to do the simplest stunts as many times as it takes to retrain the brain and inner ear to report accurately and timely about where the body is in the air. Rebuild from there to your previous level of skills. Anyone flipping as high and as fast as a world-class gymnast can get seriously injured if they land at a bad angle on a shoulder or their neck. It wasn‚Äôt worth the risk. And an athlete with the twisties won‚Äôt be able to do the flips and twists well enough to get a good score. So, Biles competing with the twisties would have lowered the team score."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,Women like Biles show their strength and resilience. To overcome adversity to resume being a record breaking athlete is awesome.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,The two-episode Netflix show is excellent. I wish her and the team all the best at the Olympics.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,Truly an American treasure.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Well, I think she is exceptional, and inspirational."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,Here here!!
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"I just love her, and take vicarious pride in her accomplishments. All the hate here is unsurprisingly predictable."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"This GOAT defines Grace Under Fire. Please run for office, Simone!"
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"I am a gymnastics parent. I am not a gymnastics parent who pushes their kids relentlessly that it's all about that college scholarship, and possibly the Olympics. What I see in many (but not all) other parents and their kids as well as some of the coaches, is anything but healthy. In fact it's absolutely awful. There is still much change needed. As for my family, the lack of parental pressure is allowing for an amazing childhood experience."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Simone, you are not only a truly great athlete, you are also a truly great person of value. 'Be a person of value, not just success' , Albert Einstein."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,I'm probably from a demographic least likely to watch gymnastics and have been a closet Ms Biles fan for years. I'm still rooting for her but also still in disbelief and denial over the last Olympic games. There were several terrific performances and inspirational stories to come from her Olympic teammates. Really looking forward to watching the upcoming competitions. Go team U.S.A.!
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,She is a marvel.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Great Netflix series, wife and I are definitely rooting for her!"
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,She is complete but not done.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,why is this American icon not carrying the flag for the opening ceremony?
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,What an inspiration Biles is!
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"She changed America? Uh, no. Such hyperbole."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Quit on the biggest stage. Imagine if Lebron James quitting during the NBA finals due to nerves!! Or Tom Brady deciding not to play in the Super Bowl because he had the ""twisties."" The double standards are incredible."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,She is a pain and she‚Äôs always crying about it.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Aw, give me a break. It only an artificially contrived sport. Her life story is not of universal import."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,The Olympics and the stress of competing against the world's best is hard on all those athletes including those who don't have all the sponsors putting them in commercials and giving them money. That's the majority. So good for her but I dont see her changing anything except perhaps the skill levels in her own sport because of her capabilities
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Let's see if she doesn't wimp out again! ANd remember, she prevents another athlete, who likely won't wimp out, from being on the team!"
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Again, America is not a country. It‚Äôs a continent. Canadians, Guatemalans, Cuban, Mexicans‚Ä¶ and more, are all part of America. The team is called the United States OF America. Our passports don‚Äôt say America on the front. Our online options for countries never have ‚Äú America‚Äù as an option ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs ‚Äú United States. ‚Äú Oh, but definitely yay for Simone."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Why must we always use sports as if they are special. They're not. Its not a job/life like most real people struggle with. Regular people for decades have gone to rehab, a therapist, had to take time off from work. I don't think we should cheer on Biles as if she's special for that. Great Gymnast, but we're all human."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,I‚Äôm guessing 75% of Americans have no idea who she is.
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,She's a quitter
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"The media provided universal adulation for her ‚Äúbrave‚Äù choice, despite the fact that she denied her alternate the opportunity to compete at an event she‚Äôd spent her entire life training for. Did we ever see any articles written about her?There is a lot of research coming out now that our overemphasis on mental health and the overuse of ‚Äútherapy speak‚Äù is actively harming people, particularly young people. The pervasive ads for companies like Better Help ought to be met with real skepticism. Most people just need a friend, not a therapist and a prescription."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"The most decorated men's gymnastics team, which is still a true statement. And while we're boasting about medals, Biles isn't even the most decorated American Olympic gymnast, Shannon Miller is."
Three big ways Simone Biles changed America,7-25-2024,"Please stop trying to make ""girlboss"" happen. It's not going to happen."
Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,"The two greatest myths in U.S. politics: 1. There is a ""liberal bias"" in the mainstream media, and 2. The economy is better when Republicans are in office"
Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,"And it‚Äôs also worth noting that along with a robust stock market Trump also inherited a robust and expanding economy from Obama. So, any bragging by the convicted felon and his minions regarding how ‚Äúwell‚Äù they were doing under his presidency should and must come with the acknowledgment of what was left to him from his predecessor."
Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,There should be a chart to show how many people died because of trump‚Äôs stupidity from Covid.
Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,"What I can't fathom is the inability of Democrats to make the historical case, which is that Republicans always crash the economy: George H W Bush presided over a recession, and lost to Clinton. Clinton rebuilt the economy, and left a budget surplus in place for Bush Junior. Bush Junior erased the surplus with the usual Republican tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. Then, Republican deregulation brought us the bank collapse and the Great Recession at the end of his term. Obama bailed out the economy, and left Trump three years of smooth sailing to start his term ... ... upon which Trump immediately used the good times he inherited as the excuse for yet another round of tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. Then in 2020, Trump's bizarre and incompetent handling of the COVID response left a million Americans dead, and the economy in a shambles. As COVID receded, it left other first-world economies in recession, but Biden and the Federal Reserve managed to avoid that here. However, the emergency spending involved in bailing out the economy, plus the COVID-induced supply-chain interruptions, did fuel inflation - but the alternative was to do nothing, and let the chips fall. Now the economy is booming again, but Trump's uber-wealthy supporters are once again pouring their dollars into his campaign, in hopes of extending the 2017 tax cuts - so that Elon Musk can get his $56 billion paycheck without paying taxes on it. Maybe Musk ought to pay his taxes, like everyone else. His remittances to the IRS could make a small dent in our budget deficit, if he was willing to pay them."
Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,"On Number 1 you failed to mention that the USA has the lowest inflation rate of all the developed world. Kind of an important fact to leave out, eh? It reveals that inflation had NOTHING to do with who was president. That, actually, Biden's policies helped ease inflation rates. On Number 17 you failed to mention, though your graph certainly shows it, that Trump added TWICE as much to the debt. Critically important, no? How long is WaPo going to shill for Trump? Is Bezos giving you your marching orders now?"
Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,I'm a surgeon not an economist. If I misdiagnosed as often as the economist are I'd lose my license. What I will never understand is the attribution of the state of the economy to a president as soon as he takes office. It's like blaming the flood without considering last week's torrential rains. Look at the starting point of Trump's presidency vs. Biden's starting point. Take inflation. Trump inherited a rate of ~1% for the 3 years prior to 2017. It doubled during his admin. Biden inherited 7% from Trump in 2021. Its dropped to ~3%. Trump inherited a basically healthy patient and sent it to the ICU. Biden's trying to heal it and getting blamed for making it sick
Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,"Trump inherited Obama‚Äôs economy and passed a massive tax cut, mostly benefitting the wealthy, and stealing from future generations. That explains whatever ‚Äúeconomic success‚Äù he had before Covid hit. Other than that he‚Äôs clueless on the economy. He‚Äôs promising more tax cuts for the rich, and mass deportations, which will only hurt everyone but the wealthy. Nobody should be fooled. Of course Elon Musk and other billionaires and venture capitalists want Trump to win. It‚Äôs obvious why, suckers."
Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,"Carl Rove taught Republicans that if you repeat a lie often enough people will accept the lie as a fact. That is the real story of the view of the Trump economy. Republicans started lying about how great the economy was under Trump from the get go. That was after years of lying about how bad the economy was under Obama. The economy the first two years under Trump looked a lot like the economy under Obama the 4 prior years. The only difference was Trump's tax cut for the wealthy that caused the deficit to balloon. The stock market rallied under Trump, but if you actually look at business earnings, the improvement in earnings directly correlated with the tax savings those businesses had from the tax cut. Again, the deficit boomed. Essentially, Trump cut government revenue and handed it out to America's biggest businesses, benefiting stockholders. As soon as Biden took office, Republicans started the lie that the economy was failing. They have repeated the lie over and over, backed by Right wing media, for the entire Biden term. Meanwhile, the actual economy has been booming. Yes, inflation was an issue the first two years. However, take a look at the last time America came out of a pandemic 100 years ago. Inflation ran very high then, also. Why? Because of pent up demand from a period when people were stuck at home and could not spend money on things like travel, restaurants, etc. Trump's policies also contributed to inflation. Prices for homes have skyrocketed in many markets. Why? Look at how many single family homes are now owned by investors instead of homeowners. Large Wall Street firms have been buying up these homes and converting them to rentals. Where does Wall Street get the money from? Wealthy investors who have excess cash do to Trump's tax cut for the wealthy. No economy is perfect. There is nothing in Trump's platform that will be good for inflation. Don't believe Republican lies. Wake up America."
Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,"I'll never vote for MAGA. Any MAGA. Period. I am all for American democracy and I will NEVER BE for fascism which is exactly where we are headed if MAGA gains control over Govt. Gains or loses, I'll always back Democracy. I'm proud to be an American instead of a republican. Always will be."
Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,"Trump inherited an economy that was producing over 200,000 jobs per month for nearly six years.... his job growth never matched what Obama was producing so he was running downhill. Biden inherited the worst economy since the great recession of 2009 and he had to dig us out of that hole."
Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,The ONLY thing trump did was cut taxes and regulations. His trillion $ cuts fueled inflation with a lag. This is not a benefit for the economy so much as a subsidy for billionaires. He blew off infrastructure and when the Dems proposed infra all cult members voted against it yet enjoyed the accolades from it back in their districts from moronic constituents who don‚Äôt even realize that their representatives failed to participate in one of the largest manufacturing turnarounds in a generation. The cult members love their hate more than their own well being.

Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,"The headlines accompanying the charts are incredibly misleading - like saying that wages rose much more than inflation under Trump but not that wages rose much MORE under Biden, or that both presidents increased the federal debt but not saying that Trump increased it twice as much as Biden. Looks like the WAPo deliberately compared numbers and then twisted the headings to say that Biden didn‚Äôt do a great job even while the data they showed indicated he did."
Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,Obama gave Trump a good and growing economy. Trump gave Biden a basket of crap. Feeling ng good about the economy is very dangerous when you don‚Äôt understand how it works. Trump is a failure at business. He is an idiot. Tariffs are tax on the Walmart shopper.

Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,Wait! What? What's with the last graph? The one having to do with debt? The opinion is that Biden has a slight advantage over Trump? Biden's debt comes to a total of $4.3 trillion which does not even match Trump's debt from non-COVID debt of $4.8 trillion plus add to Trump's COVID debt $3.6 trillion? What kind of math is that that $4.3 trillion is slightly better than $8.4 trillion debt?

If you look at Trump's policies, they would increase inflation! 1) 10% tariffs tacked onto consumer goods 2) more tax breaks for the rich 3) drastically cut migration EACH of these would add to our inflation. Meanwhile, inflation has been significantly decreased. Last month, the costs actually went DOWN...."

This has hampered the Biden Administration's ability to improve life for many Americans. Additionally, the hyper-partisan GOP congress has stifled cooperation in Congress. In my view, your comparisons do not express the breadth of damage Trump did to US civil discourse, cooperative problem solving, international relations, and the economy."

They forbade the CDC from publishing statistics about the pandemic that their Dear Leader found insufficiently pro-him. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/trump-cdc-coronavirus.html Faked numbers will have a bigly negative effect on the economy because every industry relies on government data for forecasting, marketing, planning etc‚Ä¶ Of course, the Ministry of Propaganda will just lie about those effects too.

Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,You're missing a massive part of this story. Donald Trump inherited an economy that was strong and on the rise and had been for more than 6 years. Biden inherited an economic catastrophe.

Trump‚Äôs economy vs. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äî in 17 charts,7-18-2024,"What's missing in these charts is where each presidency started. Trump started after Obama handed him an excellent economy (like Clinton handed Bush). Unfortunately, Biden was handed an economy in tatters (like Bush handed Obama). Things don't change after the election unless the person taking the helm messes it up (like Bush and Trump in the wrong direction) or fixes it (like Obama and Biden). So, it's important to take a look at both beginning and ending of a term to get a clearer picture."

Biden has lowest unemployment rate on average of any president. 2. Biden has highest real hourly wage on average of any president. 3. Biden had much faster job creation than Trump, even if you count Trump pre-pandemic vs. Biden post-recovery (since June 2022 when we regained the pre-pandemic peak jobs level). 4. CBO reported that we had more purchasing power in 2023 (Biden) than 2019 pre-pandemic (Trump). Why? Incomes outgrew inflation. This applied across the income spectrum, rich to poor. 5. Net worth also far higher under Biden, due to big housing and stock market gains, even adjusted for inflation. In other words, the Biden economy is just flat out superior to Trump's. This is consistent with history; economy far outperforms under Democrat presidents, as 10 of last 11 recessions started under Republican presidents."

If your chart is as far back as the backtesting went, the rule predicted three of the last three recessions before 2019. Two other examples of curve fitting. My father's friend Len Koppett, noticed that every time a team from the old NFL won the Super Bowl the stock market went up. It worked like 15 times in a row IN THE PAST. We all knew it was a weird coincidence. Nobody took it seriously. I showed that the Dogs of the Dow was backtested curve fitting and had no predictive value at all. Specifically, I showed The Motley Fool that their version, the Foolish Four, was worthless when it came to predicting the future. They had to retract the book that they had published. Another thing to consider is that we live in a completely different world than we did in 2019. My memory isn't too clear but we had a short massive depression early in 2020 that killed millions of people. Maybe it wasn't the depression that killed everyone. Maybe it was COVID! In other words, this particular rule appeared to fit the economy BEFORE COVID. John Templeton was not always right. Maybe THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT."

I mean, the computer modeling at the time Reagan implemented it showed that it was wrong, and now 40 years of a hollowed-out middle class, crumbling infrastructure, decimation of public-school funding, and trillions moved upward to the top 1% clearly shows that it‚Äôs not just a failed policy but a deliberately cruel policy.

How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"It wasn't like President Biden could ""choose"" between items on his agenda. Manchin, Sinema and Republicans weren't going to let the ""care"" items through no matter what. That doesn't change the administration's accomplishments making things better for all Americans, who all are dependent on infrastructure, jobs and a livable planet."
How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"Inflation is the unfortunate consequence of the pandemic and years of zero interest rates. Still, it is a far better outcome than a global recession. I agree that that blaming corporate greed isn't the best answer. Just be honest with the American people, that inflation is a global problem and that the US has led the world in recovery. Pound the message that Republicans are the problem because they have no solutions other than abortion bans, tax cuts for the wealthy, and pathological dishonesty."
How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"Even with uncooperative Republicans in Congress, President Biden has accomplished more to benefit Americans than any republican president in my 70-year lifetime. This includes two republicans who are and were criminals. The Washington Post‚Äôs incessant focus on things President Biden was highly unlikely to get through Congress even had he focused on them is indicative of the political bias that has swung the paper to the right over the last few years. Combined with the dubious ethics of its new publisher and soon to be new editor, the ‚ÄúMurdochification‚Äù of the Post is becoming more blatant as the election nears."
How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"Many people blame Manchin and Synema because ... they're the reason why it wasn't passed. But you're happy to pin the blame on Biden because ... your paper does everything it can to portray him negatively. Because obviously you want Trump to win. Your weaselly, underhanded way of tearing down Biden and normalizing Trump is an insult to your reader's' intelligence."
How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"Inflation was a worldwide phenomenon caused by supply chains and corporate greed, not by Biden. By focusing on improving the US economy we now have the strongest economy in the developed world. Inflation is under control and is being outpaced by wage growth. Without the Biden economic programs, the US economy would have been substantially weaker."
How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"This op-ed ignores the gridlock of the House and Senate, and the fact that the ""public"" ignores most data. The public knows the price of gas and eggs and little else. They would not know if the ""care economy"" passed or who was responsible for it."
How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"""some have blamed Manchin..."" Yes some have. Because he killed it. As did every single Republican. Why do Republicans get away with this stuff when they are always the culprits? Maybe because articles like this DON'T EVEN MENTION HOW THEY VOTED IN UNISON AGAINST child care assistance. 1 Democrat and ALL Republicans."

How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"Another WaPo hit piece. How about telling the truth about the great legislation Biden has managed to pass like the IRA, that has helped millions of people. And how about mentioning the reactionary fascists in the House and Senate whose only plan is to oppose every try Biden has made to do more for struggling Americans. No, instead it's Biden's big mistake."

How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,I‚Äôve given up reading these kinds of catatastrophe mongering columns by journalists.

How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"I'm sorry, but where in the article was Biden's supposed 'big mistake on inflation' documented? It does list economic decisions the writer disliked, but how those decisions affected inflation remains a mystery. The case was not made."
How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"Why do reporters and newspapers keep posting headlines like this one? Just report the News, stop trying to determine the election!! I‚Äôm so sick of this that I won‚Äôt even bother to read the article!!"
How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"Let‚Äôs review:

Inflation was indeed triggered by supply chain issues. But it was amplified by corporate pricing that bumped prices $3 for a $1 increase in their cost. The resulting windfall profits sent the stock market soaring. At the same time metro property values soared as people relocated to WFH. And the personal savings rate temporarily soared with pandemic relief checks, large Federal unemployment benefits that multiplied state benefits, rent moratoriums, etc.

The result: revenge spending triggered by the wealth effect, which led to more price increases, more corporate profits and more stock market gains.

While the Fed raised rates to slow the economy, the credit card industry jacked up interest rates on unpaid balances. So now we have a bifurcated economy, with asset owners continuing to travel and spend, while non-owners are buried in high interest debt.

Biden‚Äôs policies focus on making a better future in America. States are generally responsible for the ‚Äúcaring economy‚Äù and have brought new family leave and other benefits to more than 100 million people."

How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"People need to remember that Congress has the power of the purse, not the President.

How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"This article started out flawed, and got so bad I couldn‚Äôt finish. Another in a string of horrible writing for the Post."
How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"As to child care, the article points out how costly that would be and that it would NOT have passed the Senate. Would the moderates have supported that with more persuading? I seem to remember Sinema and Manchin calling the shots. There has been and still is a distinct need to repair and upgrade the nation's infrastructure, which is why even Republicans under Trump paid lip service to it yet did nothing because tax cuts were more important to them. Also, there was a distinct need to start the nation down the path of trying to reduce our fossil-fuel usage as soon as possible. That is not a trivial need, despite what ignorant people will tell you. Joe could not have magically made child care reform happen. He got done what could get done. Further, appeasing the massive ignorance in this country, as exemplified by certain voters blaming Joe for inflation that every expert has told them for 3 years was not caused by any one person or country, seems to be a fool's errand these days. The truth about the US is that we have become a nation characterized partly but significantly by widespread ignorance so much so that people often vote for the wrong people out of spite or to teach them a lesson or because a candidate feeds their grievance-venting lust and entertains them grotesquely when, in fact, it is them who needs to go back to school -- or just read a good newspaper -- you know, keep yourself well informed. It's sickening."

How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"Biden is neck and neck in this election because of right wing propaganda that is either grossly exaggerating a perceived weakness or is an out and out lie. I don‚Äôt think emphasizing a ‚Äúcare economy‚Äù would change that. Yes, Biden has decried greedflation, but the writer fails to demonstrate that corporate greed is not the problem that it is. So why criticize the president?"
How Biden‚Äôs big mistake on inflation could cost the election,6-17-2024,"If Biden gets re-elected, and that's a big if, he'll need a lot more Democrats in both chambers of Congress to pass even part of his care agenda. I hope enough people remember that when they go to the polls in November."
